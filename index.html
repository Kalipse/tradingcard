                    <p>Red foxes are solitary hunters who feed on rodents, rabbits, birds, and other small gameâ€”but their diet can be as flexible as their home habitat. Foxes will eat fruit and vegetables, fish, frogs, and even worms. If living among humans, foxes will opportunistically dine on garbage and pet food.</p>
